Dependencies
--------------
This implementation should run on Windows, and should run in Linux with a small amount of updating - I got this working on Linux (Redhat) when it was ~75% done, but the work since then has not been tested.

This was coded in Python 2.7, and many of the features were tested to be compatible with 2.6 - but, as before, the most recent rounds of development have not been tested in Python 2.6.

External library dependencies include: flask, werkzeug, and requests.

		Windows
		Python 2.7
		Libraries: flask, werkzeug, requests

I make a few assumptions about the data. First

	assumptions
	limitations
	dependencies

Describe efficiency constraints:
	Space: disk
	Space: memory
	Time: lookup
	Time: loading
